## Development Best Practices

### Generative AI Conventions

- If you're asking AI how to do something in ROS make sure to clarify that you're using ROS2 and not ROS1. If you see ChatGPT reccomending commands like `rosrun` and `roslaunch`, it means it's giving you ROS1 suggestions that simply won't work.

### GitHub Conventions 

- Github repositories should be named `"ft_<NAME>"`. ROS2 Packages defined withing GitHub repositories should follow the same naming convention.
- Remember to push changes to a branch with a descriptive name and make pull requests when merging branches.
- Keep people up to date on what you're working on in slack channel.
